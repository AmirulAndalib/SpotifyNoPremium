## âš  Please have a look at [#13](https://github.com/Daksh777/SpotifyNoPremium/issues/13#issuecomment-881127907) if you are getting a blank screen in Spotify after applying the theme for a workaround.
# Features
This is a Spicetify theme which:
- [Removes](https://github.com/Daksh777/BlockTheSpot) all Spotify ads (Windows only, optional)
- Removes `Upgrade` button
- Removes `Upgrade to Premium` entry in drop-down menu
- Removes ad placeholders (in Home tab and above the now playing bar)
- Adds pointer cursors to clickable elements (See [#10](https://github.com/Daksh777/SpotifyNoPremium/discussions/10))

> Note: Make sure to use the latest Spicetify CLI and Spotify App. Run `spicetify upgrade` and then `spicetify backup apply` to update Spicetify to the latest version.

# Installation

## 1. Automatic installation for Windows users
- Run the [full install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daksh777/SpotifyNoPremium/main/full-install.ps1) which installs **Git** + **Spicetify CLI** (both can be cancelled if already installed) + **the theme** + [**BlockTheSpot**](https://github.com/Daksh777/BlockTheSpot) (to block all Spotify ads). <br> <br>
OR <br> <br>
- Run [theme only install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daksh777/SpotifyNoPremium/main/theme-install.ps1) which installs only **Spicetify CLI** (can be cancelled if already installed) + **the theme** + [**BlockTheSpot**](https://github.com/Daksh777/BlockTheSpot) (to block all Spotify ads).

### Updating
You can fetch the latest version of this theme by running [update script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daksh777/SpotifyNoPremium/main/update.ps1)

> Note: I'm not very good at PowerShell scripting and if you face any errors, please create an issue.
